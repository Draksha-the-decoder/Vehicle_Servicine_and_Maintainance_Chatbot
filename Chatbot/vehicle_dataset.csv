"<s>[INST] How to check Tyre Pressure? [/INST] Follow these steps to check and correct the tire pressure: Remove the valve cap of each tire, Align the gauge up to the valve , Press the gauge onto the valve with firm direct pressure and then release. Now you will see the measuring stick get pushed out of the other side of the gauge (on a pen gauge). Fill the tire with air, recheck the pressure, then repeat as needed until the desired pressure is obtained. Replace the valve cap </s>"
<s>[INST] Why engine oil is necessary? [/INST] The purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an internal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. </s>
"<s>[INST] How to flush the cooling system? [/INST] Refer to the owner’s manual for locations of each part of the cooling system. Open the radiator drain to drain the cooling system and collect the drainage into a container (you can take this to your local auto parts store for recycling). Remove the thermostat. The thermostat is typically on the engine side of the upper radiator hose, but in some cases its on the lower hose. Disconnect the lower radiator hose, force coolant through the thermostat housing (upper hose and engine block) with a garden hose until the water runs clear. Connect the garden hose to the radiator, flush water through the radiator until the water runs clear. Completely drain the cooling system of all the water. Reinstall the thermostat. Disconnect the reservoir and flush with the garden hose until water runs clear.Completely drain the reservoir. Connect the hoses and close the drains. Fill the cooling system with new coolant to manufacturer's specification and distilled water. Use a 50/50 mixture of coolant and distilled water or pre-mixed coolant. </s>"
"<s>[INST] How to check brake fluid? [/INST] On most vehicles the reservoir for brake fluid is clear. You can check the fluid without removing the cap. There will be a marking on the reservoir that indicates minimum and maximum level. You'll want to make sure that the level is between those two marks. This fluid should never need to be topped off during maintenance. Low fluid is an indication of a problem. If the fluid is low then you may want to bring it to a mechanic, depending on your own skill level. Most vehicles have a dashboard light that illuminates when the brake fluid is low. </s>"
"<s>[INST] How to test the fuse? [/INST] There are two ways to test the fuse: one is by removing the fuse to look at it and the other is to use a test light. When testing it by removing it, simply pull it directly out and look through the color-coded plastic to see if the element (connection in the center) is intact. If it's open, then the fuse is burnt out. Sometimes you'll also see a black singe that makes the transparent plastic more opaque. Never remove more than one fuse at a time. This helps to keep track of where the fuse was pulled from and permits easy replacement of the fuse in the correct place. If multiple fuses happen to get pulled at the same time then the size and placement of each fuse can be found in the owner's manual. An easier and faster way to test the fuses is with a testing light since the fuses don't have to be removed. The testing light looks like an electric screwdriver with a pointed tip. The wire end, or black end of the testing light must be grounded to a clean, unpainted metal surface of the vehicle. If you can't find a place on the body of the vehicle, then you can always ground it to the negative terminal of the battery. The point of the testing light is placed on the metal contacts of the fuse. There is a metal contact on each side of the fuse's color-coded plastic (on the back of the 'C'). Upon contact the display will indicate if the fuse is still good. Not all fuses have power all the time. So the test should be performed with the key turned to the ""on"" position in the ignition and the headlights turned on (the engine does not need to be running). Even with the key and headlights turned on, there is one other fuse that will not have power, which is the crank fuse. The crank fuse only has power when the key is turned to the crank position while starting the engine. This particular fuse does not need to be tested unless the vehicle won' crank.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] How to check exterior lighting? [/INST] Exterior lighting is checked with the key turned to the ""on"" position in the ignition (or with the engine running, but it's not necessary to have the engine running just to check the lights). Turn on the headlights. Check all four corners of the vehicle. On both sides (right and left, or driver side and passenger side) the same number of bulbs should be illuminated. There should be two front marker lights that are orange, two tail lights, and a license plate light.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] How to change a tyre? [/INST] Make sure the vehicle is on level ground. Apply the parking brake, Remove the spare tire and tools from the vehicle, Use wheel chocks to block the wheels opposite of the wheel you're changing (i.e. if changing a rear tire, then put the chocks in front of the front wheels). Wheel chocks are similar to triangle-shaped door stoppers. When chocks are included with the tire changing kit, then they should be used. However, they are not present with every vehicle. Cases where they're not present may include vehicles with a rear parking brake and front wheel drive. When changing a rear wheel in these vehicles the front wheel drive keeps the vehicle stable, and when changing a front wheel in these vehicles the rear parking brake keeps the vehicle stable. Loosen the lug nuts before lifting the vehicle, but do not remove,Pump or crank the jack to lift the vehicle using the proper lift points, Remove the lug nuts, Remove the flat tire, Place the spare tire, Replace the lug nuts snug, Lower the vehicle, Torque the lug nuts (tighten them as much as possible after the vehicle has been lowered). Replace the tools in the appropriate location for future use. Carry the flat full-size tire to the tire shop with you.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] How an internal combustion engine works? [/INST] The fuel and air are drawn into the engine cylinder by the piston moving down while the intake valve is open. When the piston starts moving up, both intake and exhaust valves are closed. The piston moving up compresses the air and fuel mixture. The air and fuel mixture is then ignited with a spark plug (in regular gasoline engines), creating combustion. The extreme heat creates high pressure forcing the piston down. Next, the exhaust valve opens. The piston goes back up exhausting the exhaust gas. Then the cycle is repeated.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] How a fuel injection system works? [/INST] Fuel injection is a complex electrical circuit using multiple sensors as inputs to a PCM (powertrain control module, also called the computer). The PCM then interprets the inputs from these sensors and produces a PWM (pulse width modulated) signal. A PWM signal is a digital on/off signal. This translates into how much fuel is injected into the engine. The PCM then receives feedback signals from oxygen sensors. An oxygen sensor is a sensor that checks the air-fuel ratio by monitoring exhaust gas at or near the exhaust manifolds. Using this information, the PCM can adjust fuel trim accordingly to keep the engine running clean, long and efficient. This is one of the main reasons newer automobiles last so much longer, burn less fuel, and have cleaner emissions.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Why is there a gap in spark plug? [/INST] The purpose of the spark plug gap is to create an electric arc or spark of high heat to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber at the correct time. If the gap is too small then the spark is not hot enough to ignite the fuel. If the gap is too wide, then the voltage is not high enough to create a spark. Either condition can create an ignition misfire, causing poor performance and high emissions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] How to start a vehicle with a failed battery? [/INST] Do your best to line up the vehicles so that the two batteries are close enough to connect jumper cables. Turn off the active vehicle.Verify there is no odor (like sulfur) coming from either battery. If there is a sulfur odor do not attempt to jump start the vehicle. The battery could explode due to the gas that is released (hydrogen gas). The next steps involve connecting the cables. When connecting cables to the first vehicle, which is the dead vehicle, make sure the other ends of the cables are not touching each other.  First connect the red cable to the positive (red) battery terminal on the dead battery or to the jump start locations specified in the owner,s manual. Connect the black cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery or to the jump start locations specified in the owner's manual.Connect the positive (red) cable to the positive terminal of the working vehicle (or to the specified jump start location in the owner's manual of the working vehicle). Connect the negative (black) cable to the negative terminal of the working vehicle (or to the specified jump start location in the owner_x0001_s manual of the working vehicle) or to anything metal. The metal must be bare or without any paint that would inhibit conduction of electricity. The engine block is sufficient. Yet, the negative terminal is often the most accessible.  (More briefly the order is: dead red, dead black, live red, then live black. Red is always positive, black is always negative.) Start the working vehicle and allow it to run for approximately 5 minutes. Attempt to start the other vehicle. If the vehicle fails to start, there may be additional problems or the battery is no longer rechargeable. Take off the cables in reverse order (always remove negative first) and make sure the cables don't touch each other as you,re removing them. Remove the negative cable from the jumped vehicle. Remove the positive cable from the jumped vehicle (make sure they don't touch each other). Remove the negative cable from the previously working vehicle. Remove the positive cable from the previously working vehicle.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] How to check Brake System [/INST] Follow these steps to check the brake system: Start under the hood. Check the brake master cylinder for leaks. Check the level and condition of the brake fluid. Inspect all lines and the anti-lock brake module for leaks or loose, damaged connectors. Raise the vehicle and support it securely on a lift or jack stands. Remove all four wheels,If the vehicle has drum brakes, then remove the drums. Inspect all brake lines and hoses for signs of leaking or cracking, Inspect the caliper hardware and dust boots for damage, Inspect the caliper (or wheel cylinders) for brake fluid leaking. Inspect the rotors for smoothness. If a rotor has any pits or grooves then it will have to be reconditioned or replaced. Check the thickness of all the brake pads.   </s>"
